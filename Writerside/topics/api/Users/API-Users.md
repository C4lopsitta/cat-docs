# Users Endpoints

<warning>
The <a href="UsersListAll.md">Lists all Users</a> endpoint has been modified and no longer includes the list of owned and wishlisted cats. This modification was made to reduce the amount of database calls the backend has to make to return a list of users.
</warning>

This is the root page for the users API endpoint. <br />Other endpoints are also available:
- [List all Users](UsersListAll.md)
- [uid](UserUID.md)
  - [cart](UserCart.md)
  - [checkoutCart](CheckoutCart.md)
  - [wishlist](UserWishlist.md)
- [register](UsersRegister.md)
- [authenticate](UserAuthenticate.md)
- [validateUserAccount](UserValidateAccount.md)
